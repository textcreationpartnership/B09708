            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHereas I lately published a <hi>Just Complaint</hi> against the partial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of several of those called <hi>Anabaptists</hi> against us, at their Meeting in <hi>Barbican</hi> the 28th of the last Moneth, with a <hi>Solemn Offer</hi> for another, upon Just and Equal Terms, in order to debate such Matters of Difference as are now depending between us, it hath pleased <hi>Some-Body</hi> (but we know not who) to attempt the Answering of it, in a Sheet, called, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>Last Shift Found Out.</hi> And because I knew not but the <hi>Baptists</hi> might own it (a Defence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> their Actions being thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured) To the End the World might not be Abused by <hi>Shifts</hi> under the too common, but base Disguise of Reprehending them, I replyed, shewing, that not one of the several Reasons inducing me to the Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my first Paper was enervated; with a Renewal of my former <hi>Solemn Offer for a Publick Meeting,</hi> and much more, requisite to our Just Defence, and the Peoples further Information.</p>
            <p>Since when, I perceive, a <hi>Rejoynder</hi> is abroad, made up of Folly, Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and those mean Shifts his former would undeservedly have fastened upon us, and the whole wrapt up in a bungling sort of Drollery. But I am to tell the Man and the World, that I am not obliged to wait the Motion, or watch the Bark of every <hi>Libeller:</hi> Let Men shew their Faces, &amp; tell their Names, or fight with themselve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Common Charity should protect every Man from the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacques of a <hi>Nameless Author,</hi> especially, when against a People that are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Nothing but Malice, or Money, or some evil Thing can encourage any to such base Practices. The Worthiest of Men and Actions have no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Fence against this Flail; but with the Worst must walk unprotected from such <hi>Assassinates.</hi> A Just Disdain is the best Answerer; and that is what I now make him. My <hi>Complaint</hi> is out, and my <hi>Solemn Offer</hi> abroad, and that with <hi>my Name at length:</hi> It lyes at the <hi>Baptists</hi> Door, and we wait for their Result. And if this <hi>Libeller</hi> will dare to tell us <hi>his Name,</hi> who covereth his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths by concealing it; I do hereby offer, either in Print, or at that so much desired Meeting, to prove him guilty of Folly, Lyes and Slanders, which now it can be of little Service to attempt, since, when that is done, at this rate <hi>No-Body</hi> will appear guilty. These Unchristian and Unmanly Practices on all Hands against us, we patiently undergo, having full Confidence in God, that he will yet give us an Opportunity, in which to prove our Innocency, and detect our many Adversaries of foul Injustice towards us.</p>
